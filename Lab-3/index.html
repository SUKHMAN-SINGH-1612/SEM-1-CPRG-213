                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Lucy's started out as a small 6 machine operation on 17th
                    Ave, and has since grown to be one of Calgary's favourite
                    local secrets.</p>
                <p>If you're lucky, you can catch Lucy's cat Charlie making her
                    rounds at the 17th Ave location.</p>
