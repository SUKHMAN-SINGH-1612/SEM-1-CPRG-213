            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Yogurt feta sauce is the perfect dipping sauce for any fish, meat, poultry. Any finger food will be enhanced by this dish.

                Fresh lemons are in season and what a better way to put them to use than to combine them with feta cheese and fresh herbs.
                
                One of my favorite sauce recipes is Tzatziki which is based on lemon, garlic, and yogurt. Adding the feta cheese, 
                
                which is a pungent fresh cheese, adds a new dimension to this wonderful dipping sauce recipe.
                
                A touch of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cooking is ready in a few pulses of your food processor.</p>
